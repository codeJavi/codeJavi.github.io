Learning Software Development was not on my Agenda this year. However, after I moved back to Texas from Florida, I found myself indecisive and uncertain of either wanting to continue working in the Insurance industry or changing professions. This prompted me to begin my research on what alternative sector/industry I could work in that would bring me happiness – which is how I came across Flatiron School and their Software Development bootcamp. 

Prior to starting the Software Development program with Flatiron, I had zero to minimal experience/knowledge of the coding Industry. The most knowledge I had, was of HTML from when I used to modify my Myspace page in High School – otherwise, It was all foreign to me until now. 

I ultimately chose Software Development to challenge myself, and to learn and gain knowledge of an Industry I have no experience in that would help me grow and advance.
