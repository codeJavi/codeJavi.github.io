The name of the app I attempted to create is called Timedtask. This app was built to assist users who struggle with time management and organization. Essentially, Timedtask would organize tasks from most to least important, most to least time consuming or would let the user create their own daily task list. In order for Timedtask to obtain the daily tasks, the user would need to have an icloud email or itunes user id ¬– that way it would have access to the tasks listed in the calendar app. 

Timedtask was meant to be an API app, where it obtains information from the user’s icloud account and calendar, or it would allow the user to manually enter their information. The URL needed for the app would be HTTPS://www.icloud.com/calendar/. 
Once I got started on the app on Learn IDE, I installed a bundle, made the exec file, granted permission, then created the needed classes under the Lib Folder and proceeded to build my program/app. 

Although the concept of this app seemed simple, actually creating it was not. It was definitely a struggle and I had a high level of doubt and uncertainty, however, I kept referring to prior lessons and videos for assistance.
